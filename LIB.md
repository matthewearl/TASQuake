# libtasquake

libtasquake is a library interface for TASQuake, which strips away all of the
graphics and permits writing TAS scripts programmatically.  See
[tasquakepy](https://github.com/matthewearl/tasquakepy) for the Python wrapper
around this library.

## Installation

Run `make lib` inside the `Source/` directory.  This should produce a file
`libtasquake.so` file in your build directory.
